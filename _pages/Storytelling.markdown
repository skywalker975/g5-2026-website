### Trends of food insecurity
# <span class="text-gradient">Zero Hunger by 2030: a promise still unfulfilled</span>
In 2015, all United Nations Member States adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, whose second goal — "Zero Hunger" (SDG 2) — commits the international community to «end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture». Over a decade later, that promise remains dramatically distant.

In 2024, approximately 673 million people were still undernourished, and in 2025, 266 million in 47 countries were facing acute food insecurity; in the same year, famine was confirmed in certain areas of the Gaza Strip and Sudan. Hunger, in short, remains a present-day emergency.
# Accordi di Parigi (mettere in un riquadro a lato)
The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international climate treaty adopted in 2015 that aims to limit global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It drives action through a five-year cycle where countries submit increasingly ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build climate resilience. The treaty establishes a framework for developed nations to provide financial, technological, and capacity-building support to vulnerable countries. Global progress is rigorously tracked via an Enhanced Transparency Framework and a Global Stocktake, collectively accelerating the worldwide transition toward zero-carbon economies.

# <span class="text-gradient">HERO: Hunger Early-warning & Risk Optimizer</span>

Global food security is threatened by a complex web of interconnected factors: armed conflict, extreme climate change, macroeconomic instability, and forced migration. The HERO project (Hunger Early-warning & Risk Optimizer) was created with the goal of developing a Big Data architecture capable of analytically dissecting these humanitarian crises.

HERO’s primary objective is to move beyond merely describing global hunger and shift toward a highly analytical, predictive approach. The project leverages Big Data architecture and a Machine Learning model to identify the root causes driving food crises and determining their severity on the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) scale.
To achieve this, HERO integrates and analyzes diverse global data streams—ranging from socioeconomic dynamics (such as conflict, political instability, and market fluctuations) to climate and environmental drivers (such as drought and precipitation anomalies).
The analysis is conducted at the regional level (Admin1). This choice makes it possible to overcome the severe data scarcity found at the local level (Admin2), ensuring a robust, continuous dataset enriched with global geopolitical indicators that would otherwise be lost at finer resolutions.
In this way, HERO goes beyond capturing a snapshot of the current situation to provide an early-warning tool capable of forecasting evolving risks. This enables humanitarian organizations and policymakers to plan timely, targeted, data-driven interventions before an emergency turns into a catastrophe.

## Drivers

To understand the severity of food crises, HERO integrates and monitors various global information flows, each representing a crucial piece of the humanitarian puzzle:

    <p class="text-muted mt-2"><small>We shift to admin1-level analysis to capture sub-national variances and cross-border similarities that broad national averages obscure. While admin2 provides better granularity, severe data sparsity renders it analytically unviable. Admin1 strikes the optimal balance, ensuring robust data availability while retaining sufficient detail to expose localized anomalies.</small></p>
